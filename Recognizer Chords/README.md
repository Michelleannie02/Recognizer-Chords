# Recognizer Chords

### Summary:

This application is a music education game. The user has to aurally  recognize different chords. It consists of two screens. The first one has got major and minor chord sounds, the second one has got major, minor, augmented and diminished chords.


### Technologies Used In Application:

* Swift
* UIKit
* AVFoundation
* Core Data
* Firebase
* Web Services
* MVC

### Expected User Experience:

 * In the first screen, the user finds an interface that has got a play button, a button that represents a major chord and another button that represents a minor chord.

* When giving play, it is randomly chosen one among various chords.

* The user listens to the chord that sounded and has to recognize what type of chord it is.

* If the answer is correct, a success is computed, otherwise it is an error.

* If in the first screen eight correct answers are obtained, the user goes on to the next screen. If he errs three times, the game finishes.

* The second screen has got four types of chords: major, minor, diminished and augmented chords.

* Every time the game ends, the obtained score is saved.

* The user may enter the game in order to see his last three scores earned.

### Testing The App:

* Download the project to your computer from this project page.

* Once the project is downloaded, open the .xcodeproj file from the folder.

* Run the project either using the iPhone simulator or your device. I recommend running the project on the latest iPhone device. It should be compiled with the latest version of Xcode.

* If you choose to download it on your device, please plug in your device to your computer and make the device target your device model. Then click 'run'.

### Closing:

I got great satisfaction from using the tools learned in the nanodegree to develop my own idea and turn it into an application. As a musician, it is a joy being able to combine programming, music and education.It is the beginning of an exciting path.
